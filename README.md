### Description
Politismos is a game that allows players to trade goods across a procedurally generated island. As the player becomes more successful, they can invest in their trading company, expanding their fleet of traders across the island.
<br><br>
The game generates islands entirely with perlin noise and gradient maps. Players start with a set amount of gold coins, and may buy and sell goods from various buildings and ports. People will get displeased if you neglect them for long periods of time, which will lead to a game over. Try to trade with everybody periodically!
<br><br>
Possible actions:
* Cut down forests, opening up trade routes
* Buy new carts at the port, allowing you to multitask
* Buy and sell goods between buildings and ships at port

Some info:
* The bar on the bottom of the screen shows the dissatisfaction levels, if this bar becomes full, the game is over
* You start with 30 gold, displayed in the top center of the screen
* Click and drag on the cart to select its path
* Hover over buildings to see the goods they buy/sell
* Hover over the port to buy a extra cart for 30 gold
* Click on forests to destroy for 5 gold
* Carts must be next to a structure to buy/sell goods
* Easter eggs!

More info:
* This is only an early prototype, if the island were to generate weirdly, just restart the level
* Currently there is no win condition, try to manage your resources as efficiently as possible and earn as much gold as you can
* Heavily inspired by [Hachinos (tiny cactus studio)'s artstyle](https://twitter.com/hachinos_)
